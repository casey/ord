Runes Does Not Have a Specification
===================================

The Runes reference implementation, `ord`, is the normative specification of
the Runes protocol.

Nothing you read here or elsewhere, aside from the code of `ord`, is a
specification. This prose description of the runes protocol is provided as an
guide to the behavior of `ord`, and the code of `ord` itself should always be
consulted to confirm the correctness of any prose description.

If, due to a bug in `ord`, this document diverges from the actual behavior of
`ord` and it is impractically disruptive to change `ord`'s behavior, this
document will be amended to agree with `ord`'s actual behavior.

Users of alternative implementations do so at their own risk, and services
wishing to integrate Runes are strongly encouraged to use `ord` itself to make
Runes transactions, and to determine the state of runes, mints, and balances.

Runestones
----------

Rune protocol messages are termed "runestones".

The Runes protocol activates on block 840,000. Runestones in earlier blocks are
ignored.

Abstractly, runestones contain the following fields:

```rust
struct Runestone {
  edicts: Vec<Edict>,
  etching: Option<Etching>,
  mint: Option<RuneId>,
  pointer: Option<u32>,
}
```

Runes are created by etchings:

```rust
struct Etching {
  divisibility: Option<u8>,
  premine: Option<u128>,
  rune: Option<Rune>,
  spacers: Option<u32>,
  symbol: Option<char>,
  terms: Option<Terms>,
}
```

Which may contain mint terms:

```rust
struct Terms {
  amount: Option<u128>,
  cap: Option<u128>,
  height: (Option<u64>, Option<u64>),
  offset: (Option<u64>, Option<u64>),
}
```

Runes are transferred by edicts:

```rust
struct Edict {
  id: RuneId,
  amount: u128,
  output: u32,
}
```

Rune IDs are encoded as the block height and transaction index of the
transaction in which the rune was etched:

```rust
struct RuneId {
  block: u64,
  tx: u32,
}
```

Runes names encoded as modified base-26 integers:

```rust
struct Rune(u128);
```

### Deciphering

Runestones are deciphered from transactions with the following steps:

1. Find the first transaction output whose script pubkey begins with `OP_RETURN
   OP_13`.

2. Concatenate all following data pushes into a payload buffer.

3. Decode a sequence 128-bit [LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128)
   integers from the payload buffer.

4. Parse the sequence of integers into an untyped message.

5. Parse the untyped message into a runestone.

Deciphering may produce a malformed runestone, termed a
[cenotaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph).

#### Locating the Runestone Output

Outputs are searched for the first script pubkey that beings with `OP_RETURN
OP_13`. If deciphering fails, later matching outputs are not considered.

#### Assembling the Payload Buffer

The payload buffer is assembled by concatenating data pushes. If a non-data
push opcode is encountered, the deciphered runestone is a cenotaph with no
etching, mint, or edicts.

#### Decoding the Integer Sequence

A sequence of 128-bit integers are decoded from the payload as LEB128 varints.

LEB128 varints are encoded as sequence of bytes, each of which has the
most-significant bit set, except for the last.

If an LEB128 varint contains more than 18 bytes, would overflow a u128, or is
truncated, meaning that the end of the payload buffer is reached before
encountering a byte with the continuation bit not set, the decoded runestone is
a cenotaph with no etching, mint, or edicts.

#### Parsing the Message

The integer sequence is parsed into an untyped message:

```rust
struct Message {
  fields: Map<u128, Vec<u128>>,
  edicts: Vec<Edict>,
}
```

The integers are interpreted as a sequence of tag/value pairs, with duplicate
tags appending their value to the field value.

If a tag with value zero is encountered, all following integers are interpreted
as a series of four-integer edicts, each consisting of a rune ID block height,
rune ID transaction index, amount, and output.

```rust
struct Edict {
  id: RuneId,
  amount: u128,
  output: u32,
}
```

If an edict output is greater than the number of outputs of the transaction, an
edict rune ID is encountered with block zero and nonzero transaction index, or
a field is truncated, meaning a tag is encountered without a value, the decoded
runestone is a cenotaph.

Note that if a cenotaph is produced here, the cenotaph is not empty, meaning
that it contains the fields and edicts, which may include an etching and mint.

#### Parsing the Runestone

The runestone:

```rust
struct Runestone {
  edicts: Vec<Edict>,
  etching: Option<Etching>,
  mint: Option<RuneId>,
  pointer: Option<u32>,
}
```

Is parsed from the unsigned message using the following tags:

```rust
enum Tag {
  Body = 0,
  Flags = 2,
  Rune = 4,
  Premine = 6,
  Cap = 8,
  Amount = 10,
  HeightStart = 12,
  HeightEnd = 14,
  OffsetStart = 16,
  OffsetEnd = 18,
  Mint = 20,
  Pointer = 22,
  Cenotaph = 126,

  Divisibility = 1,
  Spacers = 3,
  Symbol = 5,
  Nop = 127,
}
```

Note that tags are grouped by parity, i.e., whether they are even or odd.
Unrecognized odd tags are ignored. Unrecognized even fields produce a cenotaph.

All unused tags are reserved for use by the protocol, may be assigned at any
time, and must not be used.

##### Body

The `Body` tag marks the end of the runestone's fields, causing all following
integers to be interpreted as edicts.

##### Flags

The `Flag` field contains a bitmap of flags, whose position is `1 <<
FLAG_VALUE`:

```rust
enum Flag {
  Etching = 0,
  Terms = 1,
  Cenotaph = 127,
}
```

The `Etching` flag marks this transaction as containing an etching.

The `Terms` flag marks this transaction's etching as having open mint terms.

The `Cenotaph` flag is treated as unrecognized.

If the value of the flags field after removing recognized flags is nonzero, the
runestone is a cenotaph.

##### Rune

The `Rune` field contains the name of the rune being etched. If the `Eching`
flag is set, but the `Rune` field is omitted, a reserved rune name is
allocated, starting with `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` and increasing by one
with each such reserved rune allocated.

##### Premine

The `Premine` field contains the amount of premined runes.

##### Cap

The `Cap` field contains the allowed number of mints.

##### Amount

The `Amount` field contains the amount of runes each mint transaction receives.

##### HeightStart and HeightEnd

The `HeightStart` and `HeightEnd` fields contain the mint's starting and ending
absolute block heights, respectively. The mint is open starting in the block
with height `HeightStart`, and closes in the block with height `HeightEnd`.

##### OffsetStart and OffsetEnd

The `OffsetStart` and `OffsetEnd` fields contain the mint's starting and ending
relative block heights, relative to the block in which the etching is mined.
The mint is open starting in the block with height `OffsetStart` +
`ETCHING_HEIGHT`, and closes in the block with height `OffsetEnd` +
`ETCHING_HEIGHT`.

##### Mint

The `Mint` field contains the Rune ID of the rune to be minted in this
transaction.

##### Pointer

The `Pointer` field contains the index of the output to which runes unallocated
by edicts should be transferred. If the `Pointer` field is absent, unallocated
runes are transferred to the first non-`OP_RETURN` output.

##### Cenotaph

The `Cenotaph` field is unrecognized.

##### Divisibility

The `Divisibility` field, raised to the power of ten, is the number of units in
a displayed whole number denomination of runes.

For example, the amount `1234` of different runes with divisibility 0 through 3
as follows:

| Divisibility | Display |
|--------------|---------|
| 0            | 1234    |
| 1            | 123.4   |
| 2            | 12.34   |
| 3            | 1.234   |

##### Spacers

The `Spacers` field is a bitfield of `•` spacers that should be displayed
between the letters of the rune's name.

The Nth field of the bitfield, starting from the least significant, determines
whether or not a spacer should be displayed between the Nth and N+1th
character, starting from the left of the rune's name.

For example, the rune name `AAAA` rendered with different spacers:

| Spacers | Display |
| 0b1     | A•AAA   |
| 0b11    | A•A•AA  |
| 0b10    | AA•AA   |
| 0b111   | A•A•A•A |

##### Symbol

The `Symbol` field is the Unicode codepoint of the Rune's currency symbol,
which should be displayed after amounts of that rune. If a rune does not have a
currency symbol, the generic currency character `¤` should be used.

For example, if the `Symbol` is `#` and the divisibility is 2, the amount of
`1234` units should be displayed as `12.24 #`.

##### Nop

The `Cenotaph` field is unrecognized.

#### Cenotaphs

Cenotaphs have the following effects:

- All runes input to a cenotaph are burned.

- If the cenotaph is an etching, the etched rune has supply zero and is
  unmintable.

- If the cenotaph is a mint, the mint counts against the mint cap and the
  minted runes are burned.

Cenotaphs may be created if a runestone contains an unrecognized even tag, an
unrecognized flag, an edict with an output number greater than the number of
inputs, a rune ID with block zero and nonzero transaction index, a malformed
varint, a non-datapush instruction in the runestone output script pubkey, a tag
without a following value, or trailing integers not part of an edict.

#### Executing the Runestone

Runestones are executed in the order their transactions are included in blocks.

##### Etchings

A runestone may contain an etching:

```rust
struct Etching {
  divisibility: Option<u8>,
  premine: Option<u128>,
  rune: Option<Rune>,
  spacers: Option<u32>,
  symbol: Option<char>,
  terms: Option<Terms>,
}
```

`rune` is the name of the rune to be etched, encoded as modified base-26
integer.

Rune names consist of the letters A through Z, with the following encoding:

| Name | Encoding |
|------|----------|
| A    | 0        |
| B    | 1        |
| …    | …        |
| Y    | 24       |
| Z    | 25       |
| AA   | 26       |
| AB   | 27       |
| …    | …        |
| AY   | 50       |
| AZ   | 51       |
| BA   | 52       |

And so on and so on.

Rune names `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` and above are reserved.

`rune` may be omitted, in which case the first unallocated rune name, starting
at `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` and increasing by one each time, is etched.

If `rune` is present, it must be unlocked as of the block in which the etching
appears.

Initially, all rune names of length thirteen and longer, up until the first
reserved rune name, are unlocked.

Runes begin unlocking in block 840,000, the block in which the runes protocol
activates.

Thereafter, every 17,500 block period, the next shortest length of rune names
is continously unlocked. So, between block 840,000 and block 857,500, the
twelve-character rune names are unlocked, between block 857,500 and block
875,000 the eleven character rune names are unlocked, and so forth and so on,
until the one-character rune names are unlocked between block 1,032,500 and
block 1,050,000. See the `ord` codebase for the precise unlocking schedule.

If a non-reserved rune name is being etched, the etching transaction must
contain a valid commitment to the name being etched.

A commitment consists of a data push of the rune name, encoded as a
little-endian integer with trailing zero bytes elided, present in an input
witness tapscript where the output being spent has at least six confirmations.

If a valid witness is not present, the etching is ignored.
